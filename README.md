Using this repo to build a gloomhaven helper app. The app will store character and party info, with the ability to add/remove/edit existing entries. The repo is also used for educational purposes - developing CI/CD, kubernetes, frontend (react) and backend (flask), and a tad bit of DB experience.

The code here was developed by an amateur (me :D) and therefore is far from optimal. All part of the process!
